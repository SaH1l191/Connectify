WebSockets allow for two-way communication where both the client and the server can send and receive data at any time.

Socket.IO is built on top of WebSockets and provides extra features such as:

Reconnection support if the connection drops.
Event-based communication (where you can emit and listen for events).
Easy handling of cross-origin resource sharing (CORS).
